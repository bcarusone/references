# Grid vs Flexbox
- Flexbox
	-   One-dimensional
	-   Can layout items alone _either_ the horizontal or the vertical axis
	-   Best when focused on content flow
- Grid
	-   Two-dimensional
	-   Can precisely place grid items into cells defined by rows and columns
	-   Best used when focused on content placement
