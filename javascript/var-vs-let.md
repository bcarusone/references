# `var` vs `let`
- Biggest issue with `var` is that you can overwrite variable declarations w/o an error
- When using `let` a variable with the same name can only be declared once
- A variable declared with var is declared globally or locally if declared inside of a function
- Can lead to naming conflicts
- Let declares a variable local to what it is declared inside- block, statement, expression, etc.
