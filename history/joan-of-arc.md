# Joan of Arc
A patron saint of France. At 16 she claimed to have visions from archangels that lead her to Charles VII of France to help him save France from English domination.

Joan assisted in a successful siege which opened the way for Charles to be crowned king of France. This raised the morale of the French nation which helped propel them to victory in the Hundred Years war several years later.

Joan was eventually captured by a group of Frenchman that supported the English rule known as Burgundians.

Her trial was highly unethical and did not abide by any of the rules of the time (should have been in the hands of the church guarded by women, but was held by the English and guarded by men). She was convicted of heresy, blaspheming by wearing men’s clothes, and acting on visions that were demonic. She was eventually burned at the stake at about 19.
In the 1900’s Joan was declared a patron saint of France.
